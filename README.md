# Concurrency and Threads

## Plan

### Day 1 - Concurency, Thread, Runnable, basic Synchronozation

### Day 2 - Threads Continued, Producer Consumer, DeadLocks

### Day 3 - Thread Continued, Callables and Futures

### Day 4 - JavaScript, AJAX, JSON continue

### Day 5 - Study point exercises

## Learning objectives (Concurrency/threads)
- Learn the fundamental topics related to concurrency and thread programming
- Understand the general problems (unrelated to the number of kernels)that can be solved using concurrency
- Learn how to take advantage, programmatically, of modern multi-kernel CPU's

## Business competences (Concurrency/threads)

As a programmer there are problems that can only (realistically) be solved using concurrency features

Taking advantage of modern multi-kernel CPU requires an understanding of how to program with threads

These lessons will provide student with the necessary background to use these features in any language/platform but are presented via Java


## Exercises 
- Exercises Day-1 (Thread intro and Synchronization)
- Exercises Day-2 (Producer/Consumer and Deadlocks)
- Exercises Day-3 (Returning values from Threads - Callables and Futures)
